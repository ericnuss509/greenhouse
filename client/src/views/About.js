                <p>Welcome to The Seattle Greenhouse! We are an inclusive event venue which hosts photo/video shoots, elopement’s, birthday parties, and much more.
                    We built our greenhouse by hand using close to 100% reclaimed materials. Inside you’ll find a bathtub, antique couch, ceramic tile wood stove and over 300 plants. It stays a consistent 70 degrees for you and the plants all year round.
                    We have around 8,000 sq ft of outdoor space full of flowers and greenery to act as a colorful, living backdrop to your special festivity.
                    We have also built quite the aesthetic garden shed using reclaimed materials as well. It couples as a changing room; giving you more options and looks for you shoots!
                    At The Seattle Greenhouse, we host workshops for gardening, building, painting and much more. Give us a follow on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok to stay up to date on all that’s going on! </p>
